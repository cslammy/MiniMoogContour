Starting the process of getting this fixed in my mini, but I have to understand how it works before I can fix it.
This is serious discrete stuff, including NPN based Flip flop, I am not good at stuff that doesn't rely on abstractions (IC's)

As a starting point I wanted to simulate the EG, but after many hours with Falstad I am having no luck.
Not sure how much time I have to keep working on the sim, there must be something pretty major I am doing wrong.

Maybe someone else has a working simulation or can look at this one.  Email me at audiodiwhy@gmail.com if you have suggestions.  Thanks.
